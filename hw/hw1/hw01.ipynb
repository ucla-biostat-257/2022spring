    "**No handwritten homework reports are accepted for this course.**  We work with Git/GitHub.  Efficient and abundant use of Git, e.g., **frequent and well-documented** commits, is an important criterion for grading your homework.\n",

    "1. If you don't have a GitHub account, apply for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) at GitHub using your UCLA email.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a **private** repository `biostat-257-2022-spring` and add `Hua-Zhou` and `maschepps` (TA) as your collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Top directories of the repository should be `hw1`, `hw2`, ... You may create other branches for developing your homework solutions; but the `master` branch will be your presentation area. Put your homework submission files (Jupyter notebook `.ipynb`, html converted from notebook, all code and data set to reproduce results) in the `master` branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. After each homework due date, teaching assistant and instructor will check out your `master` branch for grading. Tag each of your homework submissions with tag names `hw1`, `hw2`, ...  Tagging time will be used as your submission time. That means if you tag your hw1 submission after deadline, penalty points will be deducted for late submission.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Read the [style guide](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/Style.jl) for Julia programming. Following rules in the style guide will be strictly enforced when grading: (4) four space indenting rule, (6) 80 charcter rule, (7) space after comma rule, (8) no space before comma rule, (9) space around operator rule."
