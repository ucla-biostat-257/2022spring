    "* Statistics, the science of *data analysis*, is the applied mathematics in the 21st century. \n",

    "* People (scientists, goverment, health professionals, companies) collect data in order to answer certain questions. Statisticians's job is to help them extract knowledge and insights from data. \n",

    "\n",
    "* If existing software tools readily solve the problem, all the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Often statisticians need to implement their own methods, test new algorithms, or tailor classical methods to new types of data (big, streaming). \n",
    "\n",
    "* This entails at least two essential skills: **programming** and fundamental knowledge of **algorithms**. "

    "1. Download and install Julia v1.7.2 from <https://julialang.org/downloads/>. On Mac, use Bash command   \n",

    "You can change `biostat-257-2022spring` to another directory name you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enter the folder `biostat-257-2022spring` on Terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Open Julia within that folder, type `]` to enter the package mode, then type  \n",
    "```julia  \n",
    "activate .\n",
    "instantiate\n",
    "```\n",
    "to install necessary packages. \n",
