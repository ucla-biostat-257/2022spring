Download and study Stephen Boyd's book, watch [lecture videos by Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/videos.html) or take UCLA EE236B, EE236C by Vandenberghe, familiarize yourself with the **good** optimization softwares. Convex programming is becoming a **technology**, just like least squares (LS). Browse the documentation of `cvx` and `Convex.jl` to see which functions are implemented.\n",

For example, when implementing Newton typle algorithms, wrong derivative and/or Hessian calculation is the #1 source of problems. When implementing EM/MM algorithms, non-monotonicity always means bugs in our code or derivation. Bring the **homework mentality** into research. \n",
